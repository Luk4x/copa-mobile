## üìù About

> Watching the video above will help you understand the explanation!
  
This project is the **Copa** Mobile Interface, a world cup themed application that performs the registration and management of pools, games and users, developed during the Ignite track of the NLW Cup of [Rocketseat](https:/ /www.rocketseat.com.br/).<br>
The data is provided by its [API](https://github.com/Luk4x/copa-server) developed essentially with Fastify.<br>

### üìÑ Screens

The project consists of 5 screen components, which are:

- **SignIn**: In addition to being the home screen, the user must register on the App, and I use Google's authentication system to do so.
- **Pools**: This screen is responsible for listing all pools that the user created and/or participates in.
- **New**: This screen is responsible for creating a pool.
- **Find**: This screen is responsible for searching for a pool by its code. If the pool is found, you will automatically become a participant.
- **Details**: This screen is responsible for showing the details of a pool: who created it, how many participate in it and what games it has. You can also make predictions on these games and access their Ranking.

### üìë Other Components

The project has 16 more components that are reused by the application, which are:

- **Button**: This component is related to the highlight button that is repeated in the application screens. It has `PRIMARY` and `SECONDARY` mode.
- **ButtonIcon**: This component is relative to any button that is just an icon that is repeated in the **Header** of the application.
- **EmptyMyPoolList**, **EmptyPoolList**, **EmptyRankingList**: These components are relative to their respective lists, shown when they are empty.
- **Flag**, **Team**: These components are related to the country flag icons in the **Details** screen.
- **Game**: This component is related to the games in the **Details** screen.
- **Guesses**: This component returns the list of games(**Games**) on the **Details** screen.
- **Header**: This component is relative to the header that is repeated in the application screens.
- **Input**: This component is related to the Inputs that are repeated in the application screens.
- **Loading**: This component is related to the loading effect, used to wait for requests.
- **Option**: This component is relative to the list options in the **Details** screen.
- **Participants**: This component is responsible for displaying the participants of a pool, used in the **PoolHeader**.
- **PoolHeader**: This component is responsible for displaying the pool data on the **Details** screen.
- **PoolCard**: This component is responsible for displaying the pool data summarized and on a card, as used in the **Pools** screen.

I highlight 3 more components that play a fundamental role in the application:

- **AuthContext** and **useAuth**: They are, respectively, the context that stores user information, and the hook created to use it in a simplified way. They are responsible for making user information accessible by the application.
- **api**: Created with the help of axios, this component stores the base URL of the API that provides the data for the project.

## üìñ Cloning the Project

To clone and run this project on your computer you will need [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [Node.js v18.12.0](https://nodejs.org/en/) or higher previously installed.<br>
You'll also need the project's API running, so before continuing here, go to [API Repository](https://github.com/Luk4x/copa-server) and go through the steps on how to clone and run it first!<br>
After these two steps, in the terminal:

```bash
# Clone this repository with:
> git clone https://github.com/Luk4x/copa-mobile

# Enter the repository with:
> cd copa-mobile

# Install dependencies with:
> npm install

# Run the project with:
> npx expo start

# Once this is done, you can now access the project on your mobile phone with a QR Code that will appear on the terminal! (or by a link like: exp://192.168.0.112:19000)
```
